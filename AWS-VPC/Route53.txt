**Route 53**
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. 
You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.

Amazon Route 53 provides highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS), domain name registration, and health-checking cloud services. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to internet applications by translating names like example.com into the numeric IP addresses, such as 192.0.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other. You can combine your Route 53 DNS with health-checking services to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor and alarm on endpoints. You can also use the Traffic Flow visual policy builder to simplify the implementation of your routing policies, and you can purchase and manage domain names such as example.com and automatically configure DNS settings for your domains.

In addition, Route 53 Resolver provides a regional DNS service that performs recursive DNS lookups for names hosted in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), as well as public names on the internet. Lastly, the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall allows you to block queries made for known or suspected malicious domains, and to allow queries for trusted domains when using the Route 53 Resolver for recursive DNS resolution.
